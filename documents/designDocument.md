# 2D Game

## Description:
2d game with topdown view.
Enemies spawn randomly around the player and walk towards him to damage him.
The player must run about to avoid getting hit and slay the enemies to avoid getting overrun by their number.
In order to deal with enemies the player will be using cards. Every once in a while the player will be dealt a few cards of the deck to use (i.e. slash with the sword, bandage for healing â€¦).
Once the deck has been emptied, the discard pile is shuffled and replaces the deck after some cooldown to avoid spamming cards. There are 2 cooldowns, 1 that is for dealing cards one by one. One longer for when the discord pile gets shuffled.
The player will collect XP and money. These resources will be used to occasionally allow the player to pick new cards to add for the deck, buy upgrades or even remove cards from the deck.
Shopping rounds for cards are between enemy waves.
Player upgrades are upon leveling up.
The game only ends once the player dies, so difficulty will scale until it happens.

## Examples:
